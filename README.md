# moodys-m3-competition-2016
Paper from the 2016 Moody's M3 Mathematical Modeling Competition

In this competition, my team performed a set of mathemtical analyses of the car-sharing industry in the U.S. and made quantitatively supported recommendations for companies in the space in the future. We were invited to New York City as one of the top 6 teams to present our team's solution to a panel of applied mathematicians. Our solution was awarded first place after the presentation. The solution can also be found online in the SIAM Undergraduate Research Online (SIURO) Journal at http://www.siam.org/students/siuro/vol9/S01532.pdf. Code scattered, but can be provided upon request.
